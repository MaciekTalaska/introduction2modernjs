1. Introduction to JS
	- short history, when, how long developed, the ugliest language of all times?
	- JS was quite slow, and not used much, up unitl ~2004/2005 when sites becam dynamic using AJAX
	- Webkit/blink: originally "borrowed" from KDE team (KHTML) and pushed forward mainly by Apple and then Google
	- V8 - Google's JavaScript engine has been used as the base for the NodeJS
	
2. How to start modern JS development? Tools are very important!
	- online editors: plunkr, jsfiddle, codepen - DEMO
		- plunkr's biggest advantage is its ability to 'scaffold' a project quickly
		- integrates with github
		- allows saving the state of your work
	- Vim/Emacs - did you think these guys won't be able to cope?
	- Editors: Brackets and Atom - two most popular "new" editors
	- 

3. NodeJS + NPM
	- NodeJS is the base of all good things in modern JS, and as many things depend on npm/node
	- of course things work better on Linux/MacOSX, but for quite some time NodeJS has been usable on Windows (even though it is not being released on Windows as soon as on Mac/Linux, and version management is... a nightmare)
	- npm is used to 

4. Yeoman
	- yeoman is a great tool for scaffolding your projects. Any type:
		DEMO:
			install node
			install yeoman
			yeoman genertors page
			angularJS application (angular-fullstack)
			reveal-js application (slides)
			FAN (firebird angularjs)
			ng-fullstack
			aurelia
			react? react-fullstack!
			
			and many, many more

5. JS is the new -black- assembly!
	- there are more than 250 languages capable to compile to JS (ES5.1)
	- some very popular ones: TypeScript, CoffeeScript, scalaJS, clojureScript
	- what is ES6?

6. e2e testing
	- e2e vs integration testing
	- webdriverio, nightwatch, dalek
	- why use one of them ^ + js instead of selenium + java/net/whatever?
	- dalekjs demonstration:
		- installing (via npm)
		- some simple tests (~2)
